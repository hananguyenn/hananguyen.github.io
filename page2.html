<h2>Cheetos Mascot</h2>
<p><img id="chester"src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a1/ed/98/a1ed98ebc62b8700c90ad639c9d15d60--cheetos-cartoon-girls.jpg" alt="chester" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">The first Cheetos mascot was the Cheetos Mouse, which debuted in 1971 using the slogans "The cheese that goes crunch!" and "Hail Chee-sar!". The character was phased out around 1979.
The Cheetos brand is commonly recognized by association with its second and current mascot, an anthropomorphic sly, smooth-voiced cartoon cheetah named Chester Cheetah. 
Chester first appeared in television commercials in 1986, known for concluding Cheetos advertisements with slogans, which have evolved over time. He used both "The cheese that goes crunch!" and "It ain't easy bein' cheesy" as slogans from 1986 to 1997, and then "Dangerously cheesy" from 1997 onwards.
 In 2003, Chester was first rendered as a computer-generated character in the United State, while continuing to appear in a traditionally-animated form in some other countries where the brand is sold. </p>
 
<h2>Cheetos Mascot in the Present</h2>
    <p><img id="chester"src="http://gaia.adage.com/images/bin/imgstore/work/print/b/u/r/BurgerKingCheetos_ChesterCheetosBurgerKingUnboxingVideo16.jpg" alt="chester" style="width:200px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">Beginning in 2008, Cheetos advertising and promotion broadened in regards to age appeal, with a revised focus on an adult demographic. In this personification, Chester speaks with a mid-Atlantic accent and encourages people to use their Cheetos in acts of revenge or to solve problems.In February 2009, Cheetos was the subject of its first Super Bowl commercial. In the US$3 million, 30 second advertisement, a "loud, chatty woman" is talking on her mobile phone at a restaurant. Chester the Cheetah persuades another customer to toss Cheetos onto the ground, attracting a flock of birds to drive away the obnoxious loud-talking customer.The scenario depicted in this commercial exemplifies the adult-oriented themes of subversion and revenge, which continue to be prevalent in Cheetos advertisements produced since 2008. </p>
<h2>Cheetos Restaurant</h2>

According to the Wall Street Journal, the restaurant's reserve spots quickly sold out. </p>
