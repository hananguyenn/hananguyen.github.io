Try it Yourself Â»

<p>According to the Bee Movie:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/a1/bee-movie-script-transcript-seinfeld.html">
There is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
