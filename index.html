     <h2>What are Cheetos?</h2>
     <p> Cheetos (formerly styled as Chee-tos until 1998) is a brand of cheese-flavored, puffed cornmeal snacks made by Frito-Lay, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. </p>

    <h2>History of Cheetos</h2>
       <p>Hot Cheetos were invented in 1948 by Fritos creator Elmer Doolin. Doolin partnered up with potato chip businessman Herman W. Lay for marketing and distribution, and Cheetos were introduced nationally in the U.S. in 1948 along with a potato product called Fritatos.
       <p>At the time, Cheetos was one of four large snack food brands produced by the company, which had annual revenues of $127 million.</p>
      <p>While Cheetos was the first snack food of its kind, competing products in the snack food category have since emerged—including Utz Cheese Curls, Herr's Cheese Curls and Wise Cheez Doodles.</p>

    <h2>Cheetos in the Present Day</h2>
       <p>As of 2011, Cheetos are produced, marketed and distributed under three different PepsiCo operating divisions: PepsiCo Americas Foods (which includes Frito-Lay in the United States and Canada, Sabritas in Mexico, and Latin Americas Foods in Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru), PepsiCo Europe and PepsiCo Asia, Middle East & Africa.</p>
       <p>In 2010, worldwide annual sales of Cheetos totaled approximately $4 billion, making it the 11th-largest PepsiCo brand.</p>
